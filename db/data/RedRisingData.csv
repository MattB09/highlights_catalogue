Remember the cries 
When winter died for spring skies 
They roared and roared 
But we grabbed our seed 
And sowed a song 
Against their greed 
And Down in the vale 
Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swing the reaper swing 
Down in the vale 
Hear the reaper sing
A tale of winter done 
My son, my son 
Remember the chains 
When gold ruled with iron reins 
We roared and roared 
And twisted and screamed 
For ours, a vale of better dreams",18,18,"Red Rising","Pierce Brown","2013"
